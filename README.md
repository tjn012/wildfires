# wildfires
wildfires project. This was a class workshop exercise that explores ethics behind data collection and data science when dealing with a similar dataset like the wildfires dataset. This dataset was initially cleaned, then when the app is working in huggingface, the ethics checklist and datacard are to be uploaded to huggingface as well.
