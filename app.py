# Ethics DataCard for Forest Wildfire Prediction Model

## Dataset Overview
- **Input Variables**: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Rainfall, Fuel Moisture, Vegetation Type, Slope, Region
- **Output Variables**: Fire Size, Fire Duration, Suppression Cost, Fire Occurrence

## Data Collection Process
- Data sources include weather data, satellite imagery, vegetation reports, and topographical data.
- Data is collected from public and licensed sources, ensuring proper consent and anonymization of any private information (e.g., personal property location).

## Bias Considerations
- **Potential Bias**: Historical data may underreport wildfires in remote or underserved regions (e.g., rural or indigenous lands).
- **Mitigation**: The model is designed to minimize biases by cross-referencing multiple data sources and continuously monitoring the data collection process to ensure it includes diverse geographic regions.

## Fairness & Justice
- The model has been trained to predict wildfires across various geographic regions and forest types. Efforts have been made to avoid disproportionate impacts on vulnerable communities (e.g., rural populations, indigenous lands).
- Special attention is given to reducing false positives (unnecessary evacuations) and false negatives (failure to predict real wildfires), balancing the risk for all stakeholders.

## Privacy and Security
- Satellite data, weather station information, and geographic data are used, with efforts to anonymize any personal information inadvertently captured (e.g., campers, property owners).
- No social media or surveillance data is used without explicit consent.

## Sustainability and Environmental Impact
- The model aims to assist in sustainable land management and wildfire mitigation strategies by improving early prediction and reducing the severity of wildfires.
- It supports long-term environmental sustainability by informing decisions around land use, deforestation, and conservation practices.

## Model Limitations
- The model's accuracy may vary depending on the region and the quality of data available.
- There are limitations to predicting wildfires in regions with insufficient historical data, leading to potential inaccuracies.
- The model is regularly updated to incorporate new climate data and evolving environmental conditions.

## Accountability and Transparency
- The development team will monitor the model for performance over time, ensuring that it adapts to new data and environmental shifts.
- Stakeholders (e.g., firefighting agencies, local governments) will be informed of the modelâ€™s limitations, ensuring proper interpretation of the predictions.
- False predictions will be communicated to stakeholders, with a process in place for continuous feedback and model improvement.

## Societal Impact
- The model is designed to protect both human lives and the environment by enabling better planning and response to wildfire threats.
- It has the potential to inform policy changes in land management, conservation, and emergency response strategies.
